## Things I Like
- Solutions are defined before the development of a feature begins
- Forces you to focus on the important features (brings you to your minimum viable product faster)
- Group collaboration on solutions


## Things I don't like
- Feature presentations can take a long time if working with innexperienced developers or developers new to the development environment
- Harder to just jump into developing a UI if you lack creativity or general design skills


## Open ended questions
- How do we keep track of long term objectives/goals (ex. epics in agile)?
- Should we limit how long a developer can spend on preparing his pitch? If yes how long? Should it varry based on the size of the feature?
