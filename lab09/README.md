# SEG4105 - Lab 9
Online submission for the SEG4105 lab 9

# Retrospective
## What things did you do that you think were awesome and should keep doing?
- Having regular meetings. Helps to keep ourselves updated on what each member is working on.

- Meeting with our client helped give us insights or ideas on things we may have missed.


## What are things you think you should stop doing, and why?
- Not testing. We started the project by ignoring tests. When we needed to begin testing, the project was already thousands of lines of code long which made it difficult to add tests.

- Over-promising features. At the start of the project, we had a long list of features we wanted to implement. Over the course of the project, we realized that it would not be feasible to implement all of these features. We need to set the expectations of our client earlier in the development process and not over-promise features.

## What new things would you like to try out?
- Develop a mobile version of our site. We would like to make our application more accessible, since not everyone has a desktop computer to access our site.

- Add an audio chat feature to the site. We would like to facilitate communication between users by allowing them to communicate by voice instead of only by chat.


## What are things that are affecting your team but are outside your scope of control?
- Time constraints. With the deadline for our project fast approaching, it is difficult to have all the features we wanted.

- Other work at the same time. Because we are in school, we have several other classes we need to work on at the same time.
